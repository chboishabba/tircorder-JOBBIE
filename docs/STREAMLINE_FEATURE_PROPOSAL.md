# Streamline Feature Proposal

A product-facing description of the timeline stream visualisation experience:

- **Goal**: unify story, law, finance, and social signals into a single ribbon/streamgraph view per relationship or case.
- **Primary views**: layered ribbons for chat sentiment, financial balance/dependency, legal pressure, and detected pattern events.
- **User actions**: zoom and scrub time, filter by actor/relationship, reveal provenance for any ribbon point, and flag notable shifts.
- **Provenance stance**: every visual element links back to the originating sentences, transactions, or orders with perspective-aware value frames.
- **Roadmap linkage**: informs the build steps in `TIMELINE_STREAM_VIZ_ROADMAP.md` and ties to the six-layer architecture and finance schema.

This proposal anchors UX decisions while engineering work proceeds.
