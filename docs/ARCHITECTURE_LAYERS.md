# Architecture Layers

This note tracks the six-layer architecture that underpins the timeline stream visualisation and the broader SensiBlaw stack.

- **Layer 0 – Text substrate**: documents, blocks, sentences, and tokens with alignment to the original sources.
- **Layer 1 – Events & actors**: typed events with roles, relationships, and time anchors, including transaction-as-event modelling.
- **Layer 2 – Narrative/causal chains**: linkages between events, utterances, and claims to capture story structure.
- **Layer 3 – Concepts & ontologies**: semantic atoms, topic/issue labels, and external ontology links used across layers.
- **Layer 4 – Duties/wrongs**: obligations, wrong types, and contextual elements that bind evidence to legal or policy perspectives.
- **Layer 5 – Protected interests & harms**: articulated interests, harm classes, and harm instances tied to events and sentences.
- **Layer 6 – Value frames**: moral/ethical lenses (e.g., autonomy, caring duties) that shape interpretation and presentation.

These layers provide the shared vocabulary for the Streamline roadmap and its dependencies.
