# TiRCorder Roadmap

TiRCorder is evolving from a command-line prototype into a polished suite of
recording, transcription, and analytics tools for the wider ITIR ecosystem.
This roadmap captures the most impactful initiatives currently in motion.

## 2024: Product Foundations
- **Stabilize cross-platform packaging** for Linux, Windows, and macOS
  distributions, including dependency bootstrapping and GPU detection.
- **Refine operator UX** with guided onboarding flows, updated CLI messaging,
  and the first iteration of a GUI tailored to low-technical-literacy users.
- **Expand transcription backends** by hardening the WebUI integration and
  exposing additional Whisper/CT2 tuning parameters in configuration files.
- **Data governance reviews** to document encryption-at-rest, retention
  policies, and automated archival mechanisms across deployments.

## 2025: Insight-Driven Workflows
- **Speaker diarization and word-level transcripts** for precise attribution
  and follow-up actions.
- **Sentiment, timeline, and calendar dashboards** that merge transcript
  analytics with external context such as calendars, messaging, or CRM data.
- **Automated compliance auditing** linking recordings with policy checks and
  exception workflows.
- **Operator co-pilots** that surface suggested summaries and follow-up tasks
  in real time.
