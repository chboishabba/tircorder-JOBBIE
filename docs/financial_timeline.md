# Financial Timeline Vision

## One-liner
A Sankey-style financial timeline that tells the story of someone’s money: a single vertical ribbon for the main account, with smooth, proportional branches that peel off at key moments and link to life events.

## Product vision
Show how money moves, when it moves, and why—by lining up transactions with a person’s narrative (jobs, purchases, bills, milestones). It’s part ribbon-timeline, part Sankey, part life-story map. The tone is elegant, infographic-grade (soft gradients, gentle curves, minimal chrome).

## Core experience
- **Main ribbon (time ↓):** Width expands on income, narrows as funds leave.
- **Branches ("siphons"):** Curved streams that split from the ribbon, sized by amount, coloured by destination.
- **Events as anchors:** Floating cards (“Got paid”, “Tax bill”, “Bought equipment”) pinned to the exact moment; branches align to these when relevant.
- **Multi-account layers (z-depth):** Extra accounts (cheque, savings, business, credit card) appear on visual layers behind/in front of the main ribbon; each has a distinct colour family so siphons are instantly recognisable.
- **Story first:** Read top-to-bottom like a narrative; numbers support the story rather than overwhelm it.

## Views & clarity
- **Time as the spine:** The vertical axis is always time.
- **Colour = destination/account:** Consistent hues across screens.
- **Depth = account layer:** Foreground for day-to-day, mid for savings, deeper for business/credit.
- **Calm labels:** Short, rounded callouts that never clutter; overlapping labels gently nudge apart.

## Light analysis (non-technical)
- **Story alignment:** “This purchase belongs to Bought equipment (80% confidence). Want to link it?”
- **Flow highlights:** “Savings siphoned 24% of last month’s income.”
- **Flags:** “Tax branch grew faster than usual in Q3.”
- **What-if scrubbing:** Drag a marker on the timeline to see balances and committed outflows at that moment.

## Tone & aesthetics
Clean, premium, presentation-ready. Smooth ribbons, soft gradients, subtle shadows for depth; no harsh edges. Think “Apple-keynote infographic,” not “finance dashboard.”

## Elevator pitch
We’re building a Sankey-style financial timeline that shows a person’s money as one flowing ribbon with proportional branches that peel off at the exact moments life events happen. It connects bank data to the user’s story so you can literally see how income turns into savings, purchases, repayments, and taxes over time.
