# Ribbon Timeline Visualisation Goals

The ribbon timeline aims to present financial flows on a website in a way that is:

- **Website first and responsive** – diagrams adapt to container size for embedding in modern layouts.
- **Narrative-friendly** – transaction events can be annotated to tell the story behind each transfer.
- **Depth-aware** – accounts are layered by logical importance to guide the reader's eye.

## Comparison with Existing Tools

| Feature / Aspect | Typical Accounting & Case Management Software | Existing Visualisation Tools (i2, Maltego, Linkurious) | Ribbon Timeline Concept |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Primary Goal | Accurate recordkeeping, double-entry compliance | Relationship mapping, case links, or static Sankey diagrams | Storytelling of money flows over time linked to life events |
| Visual Focus | Tables, bar charts, pie charts | Node-link diagrams, blocky flow charts | Continuous, organic ribbon that changes width with inflow/outflow |
| Time Dimension | Dates as table fields or X-axis in charts | Sometimes via timelines, often separate from graph view | Time is the spine (vertical axis), every flow anchored to its moment |
| Multi-Account View | Separate ledgers or tabbed reports | Can merge datasets, but visually flat | Z-depth layering for accounts (cheque, savings, business, credit) |
| Outflow Representation | Line items in reports | Fixed-width arrows or edges | Proportional branch thickness, smooth siphons showing exact share of main ribbon |
| Pattern Recognition | Requires reading numbers or filtering | Cluster analysis, graph layout | Visual "standout" of large or suspicious flows — instant at-a-glance cues |
| Narrative Integration | Notes/comments fields | Manual annotation or separate reports | Event cards pinned to exact transaction points, telling the why as well as the where |
| Aesthetic Quality | Functional, minimal | Analyst-oriented | Infographic-grade: soft gradients, curves, clean depth for persuasive presentations |
| Ease for Non-Technical Lawyers | High (but dry presentation) | Medium — needs graph literacy | High once explained; reads like a visual story instead of a chart |
| Court/Stakeholder Impact | Limited — numbers heavy | Good for showing links, but may overwhelm | Strong — blends data accuracy with visual clarity for non-specialist audiences |

## Why This Doesn't Already Exist

Most accounting packages prioritise ledger accuracy, while investigative tools focus on relationship graphs. Neither tries to weave a coherent narrative of money over time. The ribbon timeline fills this gap by combining responsive web visuals with intuitive depth cues so that flows make sense to analysts and lay audiences alike.
